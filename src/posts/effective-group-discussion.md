### Key Principles of a Good GD

1. **Initiate the discussion**: Starting the discussion shows confidence and leadership.
2. **Stay relevant**: Don't stray from the topic.
3. **Be assertive, not aggressive**: You should present your points clearly without shouting or interrupting others.
4. **Listen carefully**: Pay attention to what others are saying and build upon their points.
5. **Maintain eye contact**: Engage with all members of the group, not just the assessor.

### What to Avoid

- Don't talk too much or too little.
- Don't use slang or informal language.
- Don't get personal or lose your temper.
