## Phase 1: Screening Test

This is the initial stage, which includes two main tests:

1. **Officer Intelligence Rating (OIR)**: A series of questions to assess your mental capabilities.
2. **Picture Perception and Discussion Test (PPDT)**: You'll be shown a picture and asked to write a story and discuss it with a group.

### Tips for Success

- Practice OIR questions daily.
- Be a good listener during the group discussion.

## Phase 2: Psychological Test

This phase comprises several tests to assess your personality traits.

- **Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)**: Story writing.
- **Word Association Test (WAT)**: Write a sentence for each word.
- **Situation Reaction Test (SRT)**: Write your reaction to various situations.
- **Self-Description Test (SDT)**: Describe yourself from the perspective of your parents, friends, teachers, and yourself.
